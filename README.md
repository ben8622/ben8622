## Favorite Projects:
- #### Skills in Demand *(private repo)*
  - A full stack MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Vue.js, Node.js) web application. Built alongside 3 other engineers, the application itself was not the main focus of this project but the documentation and software design process. System requirements specification, domain design diagram, and more models/documentation were created. If you'd like to see this project let me know!
- #### [Project A.R.I. (Autonomous Recorder of Inventory)](https://github.com/ben8622/Project-ARI)
  - An A.I. based web application built on Flask that uses computer vision and depth sensing to automatically take inventory of a business's supplies. This project was built for Mckesson's challenge of tackling medical supply chain issues through the use of technology at HackDFW and **won first place**! If you're more interested, [here is a quick demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIP6DAwMeYs) of it. 
- #### [Rover Control Tutorial](https://github.com/ben8622/rover-control-tutorial)
  - One of the biggest challenges I faced during my time as the controls lead for UTA's Rover team was membership retention and teaching new members how our system worked. This project is an abstracted version of the controls systems for the Rover using the exact same components and libraries. Essentially it allows you to control the blink rate of an Arduino's on-board LED from another computer using Python, tkinter, serial connection, and socket programming.
